# Aws_Infrastruture-Terraform
This code is written in terraform to setup an infrastructure in aws

## Prerequesties:

- For creating an AWS infrastructure I have used my IAM account with programmatic access 
(Login credentials are given in 'provider.tf' file)

## Steps used in this code for creating the AWS Infrasturcture
1) First it will create a new VPC in aws and one public subnet and one private subnet using the new VPC. 
2) Creating an Internet gateway which will be assigned to the public subnet and a Nat gateway which will be assigned to the private subnet.
3) Create an elastic IP for the nat gateway and associate it with the created nat gateway. 
4) Then create 2 ec2 instance. First one will be the webserver which will be created under the public subnet.
5) The next one will be database server which will create under private subnet. 
### NB: Creating in private subnet these two instances can communicate each other but no other servers can communicate with the database from outside since there won't be any      
### public IP assigned to the database server.Webserver can communicate with the Database server using the private IP
6) Create a bastion server in the public subnet to provide inbound traffic
